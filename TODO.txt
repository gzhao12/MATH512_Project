TODO feature selection
TODO play around with RF parameters

TODO create XGBoost


possible smoothing of the interpolation (compromise)
increase depth, increase the number of trees to offset overfitting
just play around with the parameters and see which one is
rotation forest

Maybe try and bag a bunch of different random forests with different parameters

DONE:
TODO train RF on no null removed rows (DONE, worse than others)
