Change cleaning algorithm to take past 2 and next 1
Maybe try and bag a bunch of different random forests with different parameters

rotation forest

DONE:
possible smoothing of the interpolation (compromise)
multiply results by some percentage and try on multiple random forests
increase depth, increase the number of trees to offset overfitting
TODO train RF on no null removed rows (DONE, worse than others)
TODO play around with RF parameters
TODO create XGBoost
